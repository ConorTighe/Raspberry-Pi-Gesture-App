# Raspberry Pi 3 Sign Language Web App using PiCamera and OpenCV
#### *Gesture Based UI Development - Lecturer: Damien Costello - 4th Year (Hons) Software Development, GMIT*
This repository contains a project for 4th Year module Gesture Based UI Development, developed by [Conor Tighe](https://github.com/ConorTighe1995) and [Ian Burke](https://github.com/ianburkeixiv). The project is a gesture based sign language Web App using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) as the server, a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [PiCamera module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/README.md), and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for gesture recognition.

## Purpose of the application
The application will allow users to practice [Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language) by printing out a letter based on their hand gesture. When the Web Application is running, a user can press a button to turn on the Raspberry Pi Camera Module where a window opens up displaying the live video stream. A rectangle box is displayed on the screen where users place their hand in to make gestures. The program reads these gestures and returns a printed letter to the screen based on a certain hand gesture.

## Gestures identified as appropiate for this application

## Hardware used in creating the application
A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a credit card-sized computer originally designed for education, inspired by the 1981 BBC Micro. Creator Eben Upton's goal was to create a low-cost device that would improve programming skills and hardware understanding at the pre-university level. But thanks to its small size and accessible price, it was quickly adopted by students and electronics enthusiasts for projects that require more than a basic microcontroller (such as Arduino devices). It is slower than a modern laptop or desktop computer but is still a complete Linux computer and can provide all the expected abilities that implies, at a low-power consumption level.

The Raspberry Pi is open hardware, with the exception of the primary chip on the Raspberry Pi, the [Broadcomm SoC](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2837/README.md) (System on a Chip), which runs many of the main components of the boardâ€“CPU, graphics, memory, the USB controller, etc. 

The Raspberry Pi model used for this project is a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) which is the third generation Raspberry Pi. This model has a Quad-Core 64bit CPU, 1GB RAM, 4 x USB ports, 4 pole Stereo output and Composite video port, HDMI, Ethernet port, CSI Camera port, DSI display port, Micro SD port,  Wifi and Bluetooth.
